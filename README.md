# Survey-Analysis
A project completed under supervision of the MCSP department chair at Roanoke College

This was the final project I completed at Roanoke College. The goal of the project was to take 3 sets of data from 3 different surveys and analyze the pairwise relationships, as well as analyzing a greater relationship including all 3 sets at the end using a contour plot. The code itself is currently messy, and the script's runtime is long (can take up to 4 hours to run all 3 pairwise comparisons using 1000 simulations). I'm currently in the process of cleaning it up so it is more organized and runs quicker.
